### Bikeshare Python Project

### Project Description
Explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington, to uncover bike share usage patterns and compare the system usage between the  three large cities.
Code imports the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

**Statistics Computed**
In this project, the code provides descriptive statistics such as the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* *most common month*
* *most common day of week*
* *most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
* *most common start station*
* *most common end station*
* *most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)*

#3 Trip duration
* *total travel time*
* *average travel time*

#4 User info
* *counts of each user type*
* *counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)*
* *earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)*

### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits

*Data was provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States*

*Project based on Udacity Course*
